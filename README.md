This is part II of my SQL project to play around with data collected in Malaysia in 2019/2020 by Szereday et al., 2024, investigating the effects of back-to-back thermal stress events on coral health (i.e., bleaching response). 

Here, I used R to wrangle the data the same way I did in MS SQL Server and additionally visualized the results using the ggplot2 package:

1) Bleaching Scores per site,
2) Bleaching Scores per Genus,
3) Differences in Bleaching Scores between 2019 and 2020 for Morphotaxa.

Please find attached the raw data, provided by Szereday et al., 2024, the R file, and a .txt file for a quick look of the code if desired.
